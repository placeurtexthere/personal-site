# Introduction
The primary purpose of this analysis is to determine the maximum tensile stress ($\\sigma_{max}$) on the beam under a distributed load ($w$).

## Governing Equation
The general equation for stress is given by the differential relationship:
$$
\\frac{d\\sigma}{dx} = E \\frac{d\\epsilon}{dx}
$$
Where $E$ is Young's Modulus and $\\epsilon$ is strain.

## Result Summary
We found that the maximum stress occurs at the fixed support, calculated to be:
$$\\sigma_{max} = 150 \\ \\text{MPa}$$
This value is well within the safety factor $S_f = 2.5$
