# Q3 Initiatives

This quarter focused on two primary initiatives: **Phase I Rollout** and **System Optimization**.

- Phase I was completed on time, achieving $98.5\\%$ success in user acceptance testing.
- Optimization efforts led to a $15\\%$ reduction in average latency ($L_{avg}$) across all geographic regions.

## Key Metrics
The overall growth rate ($G$) has stabilized, following the formula:
$$
G(t) = G_0 e^{-\\lambda t}
$$
Where $G_0 = 10$ and the decay constant $\\lambda = 0.05$.
